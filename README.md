# SmartBuilding

This is a software prototype for situation-aware evacuation guidance in smart building. The system provides an individual evacuation route recommendation to each user of a smart large installation. The proposal takes into account the current location and building state as well as human factors in emergencies. Using semantic Web technologies, this information is processed in order to determine the most appropriate individualized evacuation routes for each user.

This project has been funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid (grant “MOSI-AGIL-CM” (P2013/ICE-3019)) co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER.
